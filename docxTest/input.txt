1. Developing a water-smart economy: using advanced solutions and a systems approach to eco-innovation, a state-of-the-future water infrastructure, a circular water-economy, as well as new economic models based on the true value of water for different sectors and purposes, in order to increase rational use and re-use;
2. New digital and water technologies: deploying advanced digital solutions for water in a capillary network of sensors in water distribution systems at various levels (industrial, urban, rural, regional, river basin), capturing and using this new information to manage them in real time. Developing advanced water-treatment solutions to achieve good status of European water bodies. Enable synergies between centralised and decentralised treatments, as well as economically viable extraction and valorisation of valuable substances and energy in water. Use advanced materials in the water
